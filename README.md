NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

* A powerful N-dimensional array object
* Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. 
* Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.
* NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.
